Things to try
=============
1. Grid discretization and solving a linear system of equations per time step (implicit method). Pure initial value problem.
2. Semi-discretization (PDE -> system of ODEs)
3. Using forward and backward differences to find values at the endpoints.
4. Implement reference solution, based on proposed schemes in literature.
5. Math, math, math.
