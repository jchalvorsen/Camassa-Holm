- Introduction
    - Background, article by C & H
    - Known analytic solution: peakon (weak solution)
    - Figures 
        - Single peakon case
        - Double peakons
        - Two peakons, different heights, interaction
        - Peakon/antipeakon, existence? Open question!
- Scheme
    - u -> m -> calculate m_t -> transform back to u
    - m = Au
    - Extension to handle antipeakons
        - Leads to added stability for more classes of initial data
    - CFL condition
    - Convergence, comparison of different resolutions
- Analysis
    - Convergence
        - Mention that proof exists, beyond scope
    - Stability
        - Present matrix form. Mention Von Neumann
- Implementation
    - Improve m-> u by FFT
        - Staggering 77% reduction in computational time
    - Profiling -> faster code
    - Memory: limiting factor
        - workaround: piecewise compression. Concatenation of compressed matrices
        - FLASHY! Store tall & shiet
