The Camassa-Holm equation was studied first by Camassa and Holm \cite{camassa1993integrable} and is defined as

\begin{align*}
u_{t} - u_{xxt} + 2\kappa u_{x} + 3uu_{x} - 2u_{x}u_{xx} - uu_{xxx} = 0,
\end{align*}

or (if $\kappa = 0$) equivalently in the Hamiltonian form

\begin{align}
m &= u - u_{xx} \notag \\
m_t &= -2mu_x - um_x.
\label{eq:CHhamiltonian}
\end{align}

The equation is used to model waves in shallow water. The characteristic solutions of this equation are solitary waves of permanent shape, traveling at constant speed. If these waves can interact with other waves of the same type without changing their shape or speed, they are called solitons. 



In this paper, the only cases considered are when $\kappa = 0$. Removing this term makes the soliton solutions peaked. These solutions are called peakons and have a discontinuity in the first derivative in the peak. Peakons also have a constant traveling speed equal to its height.

A single peakon is presented in Figure \ref{fig:peakon} and we see that the peakon retains its shape over time. A linear combination of peakons is called a multipeakon, one can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:doublepeakon}. Peakons can also interact with other peakons of different size, and in Figure \ref{fig:peakonovertake} we see that both of the peakons retain their original form after the collision is over. Finally, we see in Figure \ref{fig:peakonantipeakon} a peakon and an antipeakon collide. An antipeakon is a negative peakon. What is shown here is the solution that conserves the energy, where the peakons re-emerge after the collision. Another solution, called a non-conservative solution, would involve the two peakons completely canceling each other out.
