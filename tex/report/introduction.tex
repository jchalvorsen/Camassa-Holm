The Camassa-Holm equation is

\begin{align}
u_{t} - u_{xxt} + 2\kappa u_{x} + 3uu_{x} - 2u_{x}u_{xx} - uu_{xxx} = 0
\end{align}
and is used to model waves in shallow water. The characteristic solutions of this equation are solitary waves of permanent shape, traveling at constant speed. If these waves can interact with other waves of the same type without changing their shape or speed, they are called solitons. 

In this paper, the only cases considered are when $\kappa = 0$. This is sufficient due to the fact that solutions for a nonzero $\kappa$ are obtained from the solutions using $\kappa = 0$ by the transformation $v(x,t) = u(x + \kappa t, t) - \kappa$. Removing this term makes the soliton solutions peaked. These solutions are called peakons.

This paper will present a finite difference scheme for solving the Camassa-Holm equation with periodic boundary conditions, as well as its implementation in MatLab. An analysis of both the scheme and its implementation will be done. \\
In addition to the original nonlinear scheme, a linearized scheme will be considered. The numerical results for a range of different initial conditions will be presented.
